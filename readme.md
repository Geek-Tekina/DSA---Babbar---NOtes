STL
</summary>

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of **container** classes, algorithms, and **iterators**. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.

**Containers (types) :**
- Vectors [[Cheatsheet](.assets/vectors_cheatsheet.pdf)]
- Maps [[GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-vs-unordered_map-c/)]
- Sets [[GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-vs-unordered_set-c-stl/)]
- [Maps & Sets Cheatsheet](.assets/maps_sets_cheatsheet.pdf)

**Iterators :**
Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in sequence of numbers, characters etc. They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.
Operations of iterators :-
- begin() : to return the beginning position of the container.
- end() : to return the after end position of the container.
